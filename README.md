# config
The .bash_profile should be obvious. Note that it requires the .git-completion.bash and .git-prompt.sh scripts to be in the same directory.
Similarly, the .vimrc file requires solarized.vim to be in ~/.vim/colors (create it if it doesn't already exist)
Make sure to look at the original versions of these files (especially the .bash_profile and .gitconfig) to make sure you aren't going to lose anything important by replacing them.
